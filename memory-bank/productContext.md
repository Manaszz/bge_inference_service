# Product Context

## Why this project exists
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems require high-quality embeddings and reranking. Standardizing this into a standalone service allows for better resource management and easier scaling of GPU-heavy tasks.

## User Experience Goals
- Low-latency inference.
- Easy integration via standard API formats.
- Stable and predictable performance on both CPU and GPU.
